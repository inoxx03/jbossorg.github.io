        <content type="html"><![CDATA[   During the pandemic year, we saw many stores and supermarkets adapt their business in several ways. Sometimes these changes occurred from day to day. For example, as a consequence of the sharp decrease in customer physical visits, online orders increased exponentially.  How many of them were prepared to deal optimally with this increase… ?  In this blog post, we present the new OptaPlanner that shows how to complete online orders in an optimized way!   THE ORDER PICKING PROBLEM  The order picking problem consists of a set of orders that need to be prepared for delivery to various customers. Each order is composed of a set of order items (the requested products). These products are located on shelves in the warehouse or in the supermarket and occupy a specific volume of space.  To complete the orders, there is a set of available trolleys that follow a calculated path in the supermarket and pick the order items. One order item is picked on each step of this path. The location of the products within the warehouse determine the path of the trolley, and the space in each trolley is divided into a number of buckets with a specified capacity.  The goal of the order picking problem is to calculate a picking plan that provides the path for each trolley and considers the following constraints:   * The distance to travel by the trolleys is minimized.  * All the order items must be picked.  * Items from different orders mustn’t be mixed in the same bucket, so enough    buckets must be reserved for each of the orders that will be prepared on the    same trolley.  * The bucket’s capacity is not exceeded by the total volume of the items on it.  * The splitting of an order into different trolleys should be minimized.  The following image shows a simplified view of the order picking problem input data and calculated picking plan:     WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE  To formulate the problem, the warehouse is defined as a set of shelves organized into columns and rows. Products are located on the left or right side of a specific shelf, on a specific row. The shelf, side, and row determine the product location.     THE NEW QUICKSTART   PROJECT STRUCTURE  The following image shows the maven project that comprises the quickstart:    The server side code is in the src/main/java directory and is organized in four packages:  bootstrap Helper classes for generating the randomized (but reproducible) data set used by the quickstart on application startup. domain Contains the domain model for representing the problem, and the planning classes used by OptaPlanner, for example the @PlanningSolution and the @PlanningEntity. solver Contains the ConstraintProvider implementation. rest Contains the REST API used by the client-side code to start and stop solving, and to retrieve the best solution to display.  The client code is in the src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ directory. This directory has an index.html file that contains the basic HTML structure and loads the app.js file that calls the server’s REST API and makes the web page dynamic.   PLANNING DOMAIN MODEL     ORDER PICKING CONSTRAINTS  The order picking constraints are implemented using the Constraint Streams API, and they can be found in the org.acme.orderpicking.solver.OrderPickingConstraintProvider class.  The following constraints are provided:  requiredNumberOfBuckets Hard constraint to enforce the requirement that a trolley has a sufficient number of buckets for holding all of the elements picked along the path for each order, while at the same time the bucket’s capacity is not exceeded, and items from different orders are not mixed in the same bucket. minimizeDistanceFromPreviousTrolleyStep Soft constraint to enforce the requirement that the distance between the current trolley step, and the previous step in the calculated path is minimized. minimizeDistanceFromLastTrolleyStepToPathOrigin Soft constraint to enforce the requirement that the distance between the first trolley stop (the path origin), and the last trolley stop in the calculated path is minimized.  The conjunction of the minimizeDistanceFromPreviousTrolleyStep constraint applied to every step on the path, and the minimizeDistanceFromLastTrolleyStepToPathOrigin constraint, enforces the entire path minimization.  minimizeOrderSplitByTrolley Soft constraint to minimize the orders splitting into different trolleys.   EXECUTION EXPLAINED  When you first start the order picker, you will see that no picking plan or paths are calculated. No worries, it’s perfectly fine because the solver isn’t executed yet.  Let’s take a moment to take a look at the initial data set before starting the solver. You use the Unassigned tab to do this.   UNASSIGNED ENTITIES  The information about the unassigned trolleys and orders is shown on the different sub-tabs.  Before starting the solver, you can view all of the elements in the initial data set on this tab. However, as soon the solver starts solving, you will see that elements start disappearing from this tab. Good news, they’re becoming part of the picking plan!.  Unassigned trolleys    Unassigned Order_1     SOLVER EXECUTION  Click the Start button to start the solver. When the solver is started, you’ll see that the Picking plan tab will start showing the information about the calculated plan.   Note While the solver is running, the calculated plan is refreshed every 2 seconds, causing a screen refresh effect. You can use the stop solving button to mitigate this effect.   TROLLEY NAVIGATION  Use the Map tab to view a representation of how the different trolleys navigate the warehouse according to the calculated paths.    The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Camel is an Open Source integration framework that supports the implementation of the Enterprise Integration patterns (EIP). The Message Filter EIP allows you to eliminate undesired messages from a channel based on a set of criteria. The pattern uses a predicate to decide if the messages should be dropped or not.   Oftentimes the predicate logic can be complex, and might need more transparency and control by the business user. For instance, let us say we have transactions coming in, and we are only interested in the high risk transactions. As you can imagine, the rules that govern the risk can be complicated. This is where a rules engine can come in handy, to provide for a business user friendly methodology to define the predicate logic.   In this article we will discuss how to implement the Filter EIP using the cloud native technologies – Kogito and Camel-K. Kogito is designed to deliver powerful capabilities for building process and rules based applications natively in the cloud on a modern container platform. Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel to run natively on Kubernetes  DEFINING THE TRANSACTION RISK RULES  Let us first define the transaction risk rules. As you can see below, the transaction risk is based on transactionAmount, transactionCountry and merchant information.  DEPLOYING THE DECISION SERVICE  The kogito project for this decision can be found . Let us now deploy this DMN as a kogito decision service on openshift. For this install the kogito operator.  Now let us create a kogito build using the repo above.  After the Build and Deploy the kogito decision service exposes a route so that we can invoke the decision service.  We can now invoke the decision service and test it.  DEFINING THE CAMEL ROUTE  Let us now define the camel route. We first invoke the decision service. The service returns back a payload with a boolean value indicating the risk. We then use this decision result in the predicate for deciding if this transaction needs further processing.  As you can see, the complexity of deciding if the transaction is high risk is offloaded to the kogito decision layer. The entire camel route definition can be found .  DEPLOYING THE CAMEL ROUTE USING CAMEL-K  We will now install the Camel K operator and deploy the integration micro service.  kamel install Kamel run FilterEIP.java  TESTING THE INTEGRATION MICROSERVICE  Now we can lookup the route that is auto generated by the REST DSL component and send in a transaction payload.  We can now see that the data is now available in the kafka topic.  Notice the header information, where we set the decision evaluation to decide if the transaction needs to be sent to kafka.  We will now send in a request, with a low risk.  Now, we can see the risk is evaluated to be false and this transaction is filtered for post processing, so we don’t see it on the kafka topic.  Similarly, it is possible to plug in decision points to other EIP patterns like content routing. Check out this from Matteo Mortari about how you can use DMN decisions for content based routing in Camel.  References    The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[SHAP is soon to be the newest addition to the TrustyAI explanation suite. To properly introduce it, let’s briefly explore what SHAP is, why it’s useful, and go over some tips about how to get the best performance out it.   A BRIEF OVERVIEW   SHAPLEY VALUES  The core idea of a SHAP explanation is that of a Shapley value, a concept from game theory that won its eponymous inventor Lloyd Shapley the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics. Shapley values are designed to solve the following problem:  > Given some coalition C of members that cooperatively produce some value V, how > do we fairly determine the contribution p of each member in C?   Here, a coalition simply refers to a group of cooperating members that work together to produce some value V, called the coalition value. This could be something like corporation of employees that together generate a certain profit, or a dinner group running up a restaurant bill. We want to know exactly how much each member contributed to that final coalition value, what share of the profit each employee deserves, how much each person in the dinner party owes to settle the bill. In simple cases, this can be easy enough to manually figure out, but it can get tricky when there are interacting effects between members, when certain permutations cause members to contribute more or less than the sum of their parts.    A SIMPLE EXAMPLE  As an example, let’s look at a coalition that contains 4 members: Red, Orange, Yellow, and Green.    Let’s imagine that these are tokens in a game, where your score is calculated as follows:   1. Having the red token adds 5 points to your score. Yellow adds 4 points,     while orange and green both add 3.  2. Having any two colors grants a 5 point bonus.  3. Having any three colors grants a 7 point bonus.  4. Having all four colors grants a 10 point bonus.  Under these rules, having all four tokens would result in a score of 25: first, we add the raw token values 5+4+3+3=15, then add 10 points from the 4-token bonus. Now the question is, how many of those 25 points were contributed by the red token? This is exactly what Shapley values seek to answer, and do this via a property called average marginal contribution.  To compute this, we first look at every possible subcoalition of the members of our coalition, that is, listing all of the different ways of selecting anywhere between 0 and 4 tokens:    Then, we organize these coalitions into pairs, such that each member in the pair differ only by the inclusion of the particular member we’re investigating. In this case, we’ll pair coalitions that differ only by the inclusion of the red token:    We then find the coalition value of each of these subcombinations, that is, determine the score that each particular coalition of tokens would produce. Then, we find the difference between the two paired coalitions: the difference in score caused by adding the red token:    The difference in scores within each pair is called the marginal contribution. Each marginal contribution is then weighted according to how common that particular comparison is. In this example, there are three pairs that compare a 2-token coalition to a 1-token coalition, meaning their weights are each 1/3. Meanwhile, there is only one pair that compares a 1-token coalition to a 0-token coaltion, and thus its weight is 1/1.  We then find the weighted sum of each marginal contribution multiplied by its corresponding weight:    Dividing this number by the total number of members in our original coalition (4) gives us the red token’s Shapley value. This is a measure of how much the addition of a red token adds on average to any arbitrary grouping of tokens. In our case, the red token’s Shapley value is 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5, which means that in our original four token hand, the red token contributed 7.5 of our 25 points. We can repeat this process for the other tokens, and now we’ve computed the Shapley values for all four tokens:    Therefore, of the 25 points our hand was worth, the red token contributed 7.5 points, the yellow 6.5, and the orange and green 5.5. This seems like very fair way of assigning credit for the total score: each Shapley value is equal to the token’s base score, plus 1/4 of the 10-point four-color bonus.     SHAPLEY VALUES AND EXPLAINABILITY  With Shapley values, we now have a means of fairly describing the influence any certain member had on the value of the coalition. We can adapt this concept relatively easily to produce model explanations by instead looking to describe the influence any certain input feature had on the model output. Here, an input feature simply refers to a discrete component of a model’s input; for example, if the model processes loan applications, the input features might be things like the applicant’s name or age.  While this seems straightforward enough, computing the Shapley values of an n-feature model in practice requires passing 2n different feature permutations through a model. In situations where we have lots of features or expensive model evaluation, evaluating all 2n combinations may not be feasible. For example, if we had a 25 feature model that takes just one second to evaluate, evaluating all 225 permutations would take over a year! Furthermore, there is an additional practical obstacle: you cannot simply omit a feature from the input of most decision models without having to either retrain or redesign the entire model.   SHAP  To rectify these problems, Scott Lundberg and Su-In Lee devised the Shapley Kernel in a titled “A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions”.  COMBINATION ENUMERATION  To solve the problem of needing to enumerate every possible feature permutation, the Shapley Kernel instead evaluates just a small sample of combinations. Each of the combinations is then assigned some binary vector, where a 1 in the ith position of the vector indicates that the ith feature is included, while 0 indicates exclusion. This gives us a sample of vectors and coalition values, from which we can write a simple system of linear equations.    From this system, we can fit a to find A, B, C, and D. With a very specific choice of weightings calculated from various combinametric statistics, we can actually ensure that the weighted linear regression recovers the Shapley values of their respective features! This is the key insight of the Shapley Kernel, that a simple regression over a sample of feature permutations can provide an excellent estimation of Shapley values. With these Shapley values, we can approximate any model with an explanatory model of the form:    This gives a very easy to understand, additive explanation of each feature’s contribution to the model output; we can simply look at each Shapley value to know the effect each feature had.  BACKGROUND DATA  Next to solve is the feature omission problem. Lundberg and Lee do this by simpling reframing what it means to omit a feature. Rather then omit a feature entirely from the model input, they instead replace it with a variety of its typical values, called the background (noise) of the feature. This background feature values are taken from a background dataset, a set of around 100 or so typical inputs to the model. Instead of computing the marginal contribution as the difference between the model output with the feature included versus excluded, we instead find the difference between the model output with the desired feature value versus a background value of that feature. We do this for every background feature value from the background dataset, and take the average of all of those comparisons as our marginal contribution:     Under this reformulation, the Shapley value is measuring how much this particular value of a feature contributed to the model’s output, as compared to background values of the feature.  This introduces a very important concept to SHAP, and that is the background value of the model: the average model output over all the background datapoints. Mathematically, this serves to add an intercept to our explanatory model:    Therefore, our model output is equal to the sum of all Shapley values, plus the model background value.    A “REAL WORLD” EXAMPLE  Let’s take a look at using SHAP to explain a real world prediction. If you’d like to follow along, the code for this example is found , and the code for generating the plots is .  Let’s imagine we’re a bank, and we automatically determine loan eligibility via a . Our model receives seven features as input, the applicant age, their annual income, their number of children, their number of consecutive days of employment, and whether or not they own property, a work phone, or car. From this information, our model outputs a number between 0% and 100%; the applicant’s probability of being accepted for a loan. Let’s say we’ve just received an applicant with the following details:    From this input, our model outputs that our applicant has a 65.9% chance of approval. However, if we want to understand why that particular decision was made, we need to be able to provide an explanation of how the applican’ts features affected the output and thus we turn to SHAP. To run SHAP, we need a set of background datapoints from which we can generate our background feature values. In this example, I just randomly generate 100 background datapoints, but when using SHAP for real you might select data points from the model training data or in such a way that the background has desirable properties. In our case, the model output over our 100 randomly-generated background datapoints gave an average approval probability of 46.60%, which thus sets our background value. To better interpret this background, let’s take a look at the average feature value from our background data as compared to our applicant:    Here we see that our applicant has a higher-than-background age, income, number of children, and days employed. Like a majority of background dataset applicants, they own realty and do not own a workphone, but are in the minority that own a car. With an idea of how our applicant differs from the typical background applicant, we can now run SHAP to see how these differences affected the model output.   First, we configure SHAP to use these background datapoints, then pass it our random forest classifier and our applicant’s feature data. After SHAP finishes running, we are returned a list of Shapley values, which we then visualize in a candlestick chart:    In this chart blue bars indicate that our applicant’s feature difference versus the background has a positive effect on their approval rate, while red bars indicate the difference negatively affected their approval. Therefore, the most positive impact was our applicant’s higher-than-background income, which increased their probability of acceptance by 11.10 percentage points. Meanwhile, their higher-than-typical number of chilren was the most negative impact, reducing their acceptance probability by 1.97 percentage points. Both of these make a lot of intuitive sense; a larger income would naturally increase your ability to pay back a loan, whereas having more children and thus more financial dependents might decrease that ability.   These results indicate that both our random forest model’s decision-making process and our explanatory model’s explanations align with our domain intuition, which is an excellent indicator of the quality of both. This is one of the great advantages of explainability; not only does it provide transparency into model decisions, it also allows for sanity-checking of model behavior.    TIPS AND TRICKS   INTERPRETING SHAP EXPLANATIONS  As we’ve seen, a SHAP value describes the effect a particular feature had on the model output, as compared to the background features. This comparison can introduce some confusion as to the meaning of the raw Shapley values, and make finding clear intuition a little trickier. This is especially true when the reference points are not clearly defined.  For example:   * “Your income increased your acceptance probability by 11.10 percentage    points.”  * “You own a car, which reduced your acceptance probability 0.67 percentage    points.”  This explains the income’s effect on the outcome, but does not answer what about the applicant’s income affected the result. Was it too high? Was it too low? There is an explanation, but it is too vague to be actionable in any meaningful way. Instead, we can try directly comparing the applicant’s feature value to the average background value of that feature. This makes the Shapley value’s implicit comparison to the background explicitly clear:   * “Your income is $36k higher than a typical income, which increased your    acceptance probability by 11.10 percentage points.”  * “You own a car, which we see in only 39% of typical loan applicants. Because    of this, your acceptance probability was reduced by 0.67 percentage points.”  Not only does this convey the comparison being made by the Shapley value, but it also provides the applicant some actionable information about their outcome, e.g.,  “Having a high income and number of consecutive days of employment really helped my loan application, I should take this into account when I’m thinking about retiring.” In a way, this makes a SHAP explanation analagous to a : it informs you of any potential changes you might be able to make to influence your outcome.    MODEL BACKGROUND CHOICE  Since the explanations produced by SHAP are comparisons against the background dataset, the choice of background data is highly influential on the returned Shapley values. For example, here are three sets of SHAP explanations for the same model and input (the specific details of which aren’t important), just with three different choices of background:    Despite the input data point and model not changing, the directions of the Shapley values vary wildly; for example, the first Shapley value is +13 for the first background selection, +0.27 for the second, and -6.74 with the third. All of these these Shapley values arrive at the same end prediction, and thus are all accurate explanations of the model’s behavior, but convey different information due to their differing comparisons. The choice as to which set of values is better is subjective and domain specific, and as such  the choice of background datapoints needs to done with careful intent. In general, you should try playing around with various choices to see what produces the clearest and most helpful explanations.     CONCLUSIONS  In this post, we’ve explored the theoretical foundation of SHAP, examined how the SHAP Kernel Explainer produces explanations, and how we can interpret these explanations as much insight as we can.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 4 - Example architecture with GitOps  In our  from this series we talked about the example predictive analysis architecture found in an edge medical diagnosis solution for the healthcare industry.       The process was laid out how we approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architecture. It continued by discussion how we approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architecture.    Now it's time to look at one final example architecture.  This article walks you through an example architecture for using GitOps for providing a deployment and development example for edge medical diagnosis scenarios.     ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are based on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common architecture that was uncovered while researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architecture, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this architecture and outline the solution for two views of the edge medical diagnosis architecture solution.        EDGE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS WITH GITOPS  After touring the solution architecture and elements in the previous article related to actual edge medical diagnosis, this diagram shows us something entirely different. It's a matter of perspective and now we are looking at it from a development and operations perspective, using the lens of GitOps.   In the diagram above we start on the right side by the developer and IT operations users, who both are developing their own specific code bases. The developer is working on services, applications, and other integration aspects in their projects. Over in IT operations they are concerned with deployments and infrastructure as code for both agility and scalability, using for example configuration as code projects.   Both of these users are pushing their contributions into the source code management (SCM) system where it's then pulled into the CI/CD pipeline for the build processing which could require the use of, for example, standard base images from the remote image repository (shown here as the Red Hat repository).   These builds result in application and service images in the image repository for developers which is then pushed out to the subscribed diagnostic facilities in the field. For the IT operations you'll see their configuration and manifest code pushed out to the subscribed diagnostic facilities where they host source code management (SCM) systems in the field.    At this point we transition our discussion to the diagnostic facility where the field application of the medical diagnosis solutions are applied. A GitOps element can be found that uses Argo CD to manage specific resources, including images and operations code based configurations and manifests to define the management of users, deployments, and architectural behaviours.    Finally, we see this all come to fruition on the far left of this diagram as the control plane, a container platform based on OpenShift, hosts the various services and applications in their container-based runtimes.   Next up, a look at the architectural solution with a focus on the data view.        EDGE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS WITH GITOPS (DATA)  Data connectivity through the edge medical diagnosis architecture with GitOps provides a different look at the architecture and gives us insights into how one of the most valuable assets of a healthcare organisation is being processed.

It is the latest update release for use on all JDK9+ runtimes up to and including JDK18.    Byteman 4.0.18 is a maintenance release which provides one enhancement, enabling the choice of TARGET vs TRIGGER semantics when rules inject down class or interface hierarchies. For rules of this type it is possible that the TARGET class/interface for the rule, the one named in the CLASS clause, may differ from the TRIGGER class, the subclass or interface implementation into which the rule actually gets injected. An AS TARGET clause in the rule body requests that the rule is typed lexically using TARGET class as the type for $this/$0. An AS TRIGGER clause means it is typed dynamically using the TRIGGER class as the type for $this/$0. Note that up to now Byteman has always used TRIGGER semantics and will continue to use this as the default. More details are provided in the and the latest Byteman Programmers Guide. ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 3 - Example predictive analysis  In our  from this series we talked about the logical common architectural elements found in an edge medical diagnosis solution for the healthcare industry.       The process was laid out how we approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architecture. It continued by laying out the process of how we approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architecture.    Having completed our discussions on the logical view of the architecture, it's now time to look at a specific example.  This article walks you through an example predictive analysis scenario showing how expanding the previously discussed elements provides an example for edge medical diagnosis scenarios.     ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are based on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common architecture that was uncovered while researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architecture, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this architecture and outline the solution for two views of the edge medical diagnosis architecture solution.        EDGE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS (NETWORK)  The first look is of the overall architecture for edge medical diagnosis with the details filled in that were discussed as logical elements previously. Starting on the left side of the diagram, there are two entry points for the actors you can expect for this use case. One is representing the edge devices, in this case an x-ray machine behind the x-ray diagnostic server, which is collecting the initial images. The other is the medical staff in the clinical environment receiving notifications for results from the automated image analysis and diagnosis process. On the right side of the diagram you find the development user, a data scientist.    First we will explore the edge devices, from the x-ray diagnostic server, as images make their way through the architecture. After that, we'll examine the medical staff as a user and the interactions they have with the architectural solution. Finally, we'll swing to the other side and dive into the process flow of a data scientist as they develop their solutions for this architecture.   The images enter the container platform as they are collected by the image receiver which is a Python application in this architecture. The images are then persisted, passed to the pipeline dashboard to provide an overview of a diagnosis process in progress, and given to the pneumonia diagnosis application for analysis. Here the application is using the provided data and models provided together with artificial intelligence to assess images for pneumonia. At the same time, these images and the data associated with them are being cleaned up by the data anonymisation application before they are transferred back through the streaming integration services to the central medical data center into the x-ray storage element.   The medical staff is waiting on their systems for the notification service to alert them when a diagnosis is ready for them to examine. Some images might lead to the medical staff having to make the diagnosis themselves, but more often they are notified that the specific patient images have been detected (or not) as containing traces of pneumonia.    Back at the medical data center, the data scientist is tasked with defining, modifying, and continually working with the stream of new images and data that the diagnostic facilities are generating. She uses all of that data along with the data science tooling to continually improve the manual classification application. The source code management system (SCM) together with the machine learning CI/CD tools generates new application images for the image registry. These application images are shared back out to the diagnostic facilities' image registries for deployment to update the existing applications in their process.   Finally there is a facility statistical dashboard used to provide an overview of the entire medial diagnosis architecture's performance.   While this view is of the network connections, it's not a hard binding for your own architecture. Think of this as the rough outline of what a successful architecture looks like and mapping that to your very own situation is a matter of applying your domain knowledge together with this guide.   Next up, a look at the architectural solution with a focus on the data view.        EDGE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS (DATA)  Data connectivity through the edge medical diagnosis architecture provides a different look at the architecture and gives us insights into how one of the most valuable assets of a healthcare organisation is being processed.   It should be seen as the architecture is intended, as a guide and not a definitive must-do-it-this-way statement on how the data is being routed through as actors are engaging with the systems, applications, and services in this architecture.   Note that many of the data flows only one direction while it's fairly obvious it's going to flow both ways. We've chosen to note that in the flows that do not disrupt the clarity of the architecture diagram, and chose not to indicate where the intent is to show processing and flows for clarity from actors to systems on the backend.   It's left to the reader to explore these data diagrams and feel free to send comments our way.     WHAT'S NEXT  This was an overview of the specific pneumonia detection schematic diagrams that make up our architecture for the edge medical diagnosis use case.    An overview of this series on edge medical diagnosis architecture:   1.   2.   3.   4.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Drools community discusses various usage, issues and questions on google group ( , ) and zulip chat () daily basis.  When we discuss the usage of a specific feature or syntax (for example, "accumulate"), our documentation () is the best resource but there may be cases where users stumble when they try a little different thing from what is written. In that case, a simple reproducer project is very helpful to communicate each other rather than guessing based on a rule snippet.  In the below blog post, Luca explained how to create a kjar reproducer with maven archetype.    In this blog post, I’d like to explain basic variants of such reproducer projects by sharing my examples. Also such simple projects are useful for beginners to learn Drools.    Note that these example project names have Drools version number at the end (e.g. 7.61). Sorry that I don’t manage them with git branches because I create them sporadically. Anyway, we always recommend to use the latest version. When you clone and try the examples, please modify them to use the latest Drools version.   BASIC DRL    The simplest example. It’s almost the same as a project created by kie-drools-archetype (but not a kjar). getKieClasspathContainer() is convenient when you collect all assets in your project classpath.           KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();         KieContainer kcontainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer();         KieBase kbase = kcontainer.getKieBase();         KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession();   You can run DroolsTest with your IDE or maven.   $ mvn clean test ... Hello, John   You can easily create variant projects from this. e.g. Ex-accumulate, Ex-agenda-group …  Note that this example uses non-executable-model. If you want to test an executable-model issue, see Ex-basic-kjar-em or Ex-KieFileSystem-em.   KJAR AND RUNNER      A simple kjar example. When you build the Ex-basic-kjar project with mvn clean install, the kjar is installed to your local maven repository. So you can run the kjar with Ex-basic-kjar-runner.   $ mvn clean test ... Hello, John   See that DroolsTest in Ex-basic-kjar-runner specifies maven GAV (GroupId, ArtifactId, Version) so it can load the kjar from your maven repository.           ReleaseId releaseId = ks.newReleaseId("com.sample", "basic-kjar", "1.0.0");         KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(releaseId);   Note that both pprojects have drools-engine-classic dependency. It means they use non-executable-model. See the next projects for executable-model.       <dependency>       <groupId>org.drools</groupId>       <artifactId>drools-engine-classic</artifactId>       <version>${drools.version}</version>     </dependency>    EXECUTABLE-MODEL KJAR      This is "executable-model" version of Ex-basic-kjar / Ex-basic-kjar-runner. Rules and Java codes are the same as non-executable-model version (except its artifactId). You will just find drools-engine dependency in pom.xml files, which is an assembler dependency for executable-model.       <dependency>       <groupId>org.drools</groupId>       <artifactId>drools-engine</artifactId>       <version>${drools.version}</version>     </dependency>   You can run the kjar with the same steps as Ex-basic-kjar / Ex-basic-kjar-runner projects. When running DroolsTest, you will confirm the log that the kjar is built with executable-model.   $ mvn clean test ... [main] INFO  Artifact com.sample:basic-kjar-em:1.0.0 has executable model ... Hello, John    PROGRAMMATICALLY CREATE A KJAR    If you want to programmatically create a kjar so that you can have control on which assets to build, you would use KieFileSystem instead of getKieClasspathContainer().           // KieFileSystem is responsible for gathering resources         KieFileSystem kfs = ks.newKieFileSystem();          // You can add your DRL files as InputStream here         kfs.write("src/main/resources/com/sample/Sample1.drl",                   ks.getResources().newInputStreamResource(new FileInputStream(new File("work/Sample1.drl"))));         kfs.write("src/main/resources/com/sample/12345.drl",                   ks.getResources().newInputStreamResource(new FileInputStream(new File("work/Sample2.drl"))));          // You need to specify a unique ReleaseId per KieContainer (= the unit which you store a set of DRL files)         // ReleaseId consists of "GroupId" + "ArtifactId" + "Version". The same idea of Maven artifact.         ReleaseId releaseId = ks.newReleaseId("com.sample", "my-sample-a", "1.0.0");         kfs.generateAndWritePomXML(releaseId);          // Now resources are built and stored into an internal repository         ks.newKieBuilder(kfs).buildAll();          // You can get a KieContainer with the ReleaseId         KieContainer kcontainer = ks.newKieContainer(releaseId);   See that this example adds work/Sample1.drl and work/Sample2.drl files to the KieFileSystem so only rules in these files are fired.   EXECUTABLE-MODEL WITH KIEFILESYSTEM    You can use executable-model with KieFileSystem. The code difference from the previous project is only this line:           ks.newKieBuilder(kfs).buildAll(ExecutableModelProject.class);   Also note that you need to have drools-engine dependency instead of drools-engine-classic.  In this example, I additionally enabled this debug log in logback-test.xml      <logger name="org.drools.modelcompiler.builder" level="debug"/>   So you will see generated executable-model Java sources as debug log.   public class RulesCF20A831C922E3C97396E3F20148B0A2RuleMethods0 {      /**      * Rule name: Hello World 1      */     public static org.drools.model.Rule rule_Hello_32World_321() {         final org.drools.model.Variable<com.sample.Person> var_GENERATED_$pattern_Person$1$ = D.declarationOf(com.sample.Person.class,                                                                                                               DomainClassesMetadataCF20A831C922E3C97396E3F20148B0A2.com_sample_Person_Metadata_INSTANCE,                                                                                                               "GENERATED_$pattern_Person$1$");         org.drools.model.Rule rule = D.rule("com.sample",                                             "Hello World 1")                                       .build(D.pattern(var_GENERATED_$pattern_Person$1$),                                              D.execute(com.sample.P06.LambdaConsequence06CFDB45165A059504338D25A218B880.INSTANCE));         return rule;     } ...    KIE-SERVER EXAMPLE      This is an example to run a kjar in kie-server. Typically, you would create and build a project in business-central and then deploy it to kie-server using business-central UI. But you can also build a kjar with maven and then deploy it to kie-server using kie-server-client API. This is quicker than operating UI so useful for a reproducer and testing back-and-forth.  You can build Ex-kie-server-kjar with maven as usual.   $ mvn clean install   Then run CreateContainer in Ex-kie-server-client to deploy the kjar to your kie-server. Of course, you have to start your kie-server beforehand. You can download jbpm-server-x.x.x.Final-dist.zip via  which is all-in-one distribution. You will see console log at kie-server side (e.g. WildFly) that tells the kjar is deployed and started.   INFO  [org.kie.server.services.impl.KieServerImpl] (default task-2) Container kie-server-kjar-example_1.0.0 (for release id com.sample:kie-server-kjar-example:1.0.0) successfully started   Now you can run StatefulTest or StatelessTest.   $ mvn test -Dtest=StatelessTest ... ----------------------------------- ServiceResponse[SUCCESS, msg='Container kie-server-kjar-example_1.0.0 successfully called.', result='org.drools.core.runtime.impl.ExecutionResultImpl@682abca7'] results = [hit Hello rule]    AND MORE…  I cannot go through all examples but please just try if you find anything interesting!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[WHAT IS A SAGA?  Saga is a design pattern to manage data consistency across participants in distributed transaction scenarios.   NOTE: In a microservice world, a participant could be defined as a microservice, responsible to perform actions related to its business domain.  In summary, Saga is meant to provide transaction management using a sequence of steps that could be also called local transactions. In this way, each action performed by a participant is a local transaction.  While executing a transaction, failures might happen, in this situation, a sequence of compensating actions (or local transactions) are executed to undo the changes that were made during the execution, or to leave the system in a known termination state, aiming for consistency.   With that said, Saga is not a solution for strong consistency like the Two-Phase Commit (2PC), but it is more about eventual consistency, which means at some point in time the system will reach a consistent state.  The concept of Saga is not new; the initial idea was published in this in ’87, by Hector Garcaa-Molrna and Kenneth Salem. Besides, the topic has been discussed a lot in the community, mainly after the popularization of microservices architecture.  Ok, that is fine, but let’s take an example to see how it works in practice, things are always easier with a concrete example.   THE ORDER FULFILLMENT EXAMPLE  This is a very common use case, present in many companies and for sure it should be familiar to you.   The basic idea in this scenario is a user buys some item through an e-commerce application inputting the payment method and delivery information and waits for this item to be delivered at the specified address.  So given this use case, what in general happens behind the scenes is a sequence of steps that should be executed to complete the order, as shown in the picture:  In the example there are mainly the following steps:   1. Order checkout: the user confirms the order with the chosen items, payment     method, and delivery address.  2. Stock reservation: where this item from the order is selected from the stock     and reserved, being removed from the total stock item.  3. Payment processing: based on the payment method and the user information,     for instance, the credit card, the credit is checked and allocated to that     payment.  4. Shipping schedule: it represents a scheduling mechanism that could     communicate with third-party companies responsible to deliver orders or even     an internal system responsible for logistics and delivery.  Based on described steps, let’s see how a simple microservice architecture could be used to implement this example:  This architecture is composed mainly of 4 microservices, each one of them is responsible for a specific business domain.  Order: the entry point for the communication with a frontend application where the user does the checkout and besides it is the service that controls the order and all the lifecycle of an order.  Stock: this service is responsible to keep track and control the item’s stock, reserving or releasing items from the stock.  Payment: this service has a well-defined role, to process the payment for an order, it could even handle communication with different credit card providers, for example.  Shipping: control the order delivery and the delivery scheduling and similar to the payment service, it could communicate with third-party providers.  Let’s abstract the communication technology used by them, it could be through REST, Messaging with Kafka, gRPC, etc. But this is not important for now, the most important thing is to identify that each microservice is responsible for a domain and they are performing actions (local transactions) to the respective domain they own.  Now that we have an understating of the problem, let’s see how Saga could be used to implement it in a very quick way.   In the below picture, it is possible to visualize the two main flows during the order fulfillment process.  In the first case, the happy path, the stock is reserved, after that, the payment is successfully processed and finally, the shipping is scheduled and done for that order.  The second case describes an example where a failure or any error is thrown during the shipping process for an order, and in this situation, a sequence of compensation actions are executed, to cancel the payment and to release the stock for the items in the given order.  In general, there are two approaches to address this kind of problem. Choreography and Orchestration.  Choreography requires each participant to react to an event, or to something that has happened in the system, thus each participant should be aware of things or events that might happen to other participants. There is no central point where the business logic is defined; it is spread in all the participants which give more flexibility.  Orchestration centralizes complexity and the business logic into a single entity, also called Saga Execution Coordinator (SEC) which is the component that orchestrates calls to the participants, thus services should only be aware of their own domain events. This makes things easier to monitor, evolve and change over time, but introduces a potential single point of failure.  In the article, , from Martin Fowler, there is this interesting part:  "The danger is that it’s very easy to make nicely decoupled systems with event notification, without realizing that you’re losing sight of that larger-scale flow, and thus set yourself up for trouble in future years".   In some situations, a choreography approach that is all event-driven, which might contain a huge number of steps, and many microservices interacting with each other things could become very complex to maintain. The orchestration could be very useful to decrease complexity. It provides and an easier way to have control regarding what is going on in the whole system, what is being executed, and even to detect potential errors that might impact the business.  With a centralized workflow, it is easier to evolve the architecture, adding or removing steps and microservices.   CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT SAGAS AND ORCHESTRATION APPROACH   * Stateful: keep track of each executed step in a persistent way  * Saga workflow declaration, is way to declare the workflow, all the steps and    compensations  * Each action, or step, might have a correspondent compensation for it  * Actions must be idempotent, this means to be executed multiple times with no    impact, which allows fault tolerance and retries. This is important mainly    considering the remote communication among the participants   KOGITO AS A SAGA ORCHESTRATOR  Kogito process runtime allows the execution of workflows in a lightweight and cloud-native way, this is a great fit to implement a Saga Coordinator Executor (SEC) because a Saga can be modeled as a process, where we can define a sequence of steps and compensations for each step, besides all the decisions and logic control we have with processes. Error handling is another useful feature when designing Saga as a process, more information was published in this .  Leveraging Kogito capabilities it is possible to achieve a scalable stateful workflow control, with different pluggable persistence mechanisms that control the executions and the compensations that might be executed in case of a failure or an unexpected in a given step of the workflow.  Timer events are another important feature to control async communication, for instance when a message is sent in a process and it waits for another message to come, timers can be used as a timeout control in this situation. This is not a simple in-memory control like in a timeout for an HTTP request, this is a stateful control with wait states to not block the process runtime. This feature makes use of the Job Service, which is a microservice responsible for controlling timers in Kogito.  Kogito includes supporting services like Data-Index and Management Console that provide out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities that are useful to check the Saga execution in a UI and expose query APIs in case some integration is needed.  There are different ways to declare a workflow in kogito, for example, BPMN2 or Serverless Workflow, and they are easily integrated with Decisions, either DMN and DRLs that could be very helpful to evaluate data and choose a path to be executed in a Saga.   TO BE CONTINUED…  In the next blog post, it will be covered a concrete example implemented with processes and Kogito to declare and run the order fulfillment Saga, where kogito will play the orchestrator role.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 2 - Common architectural elements  In our  from this series we introduced a use case around edge medical diagnosis for the healthcare industry.      The process was laid out how we approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architecture.    The only thing left to cover was the order in which you'll be led through the details.  This article starts the real journey at the very top, with a generic architecture from which we'll discuss the common architectural elements one by one.     ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are based on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common architecture that was uncovered while researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architecture, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this architecture and outline the solution.     FROM SPECIFIC TO GENERIC  Before diving into the common elements, it might be nice to understand that this is not a catch all for every possible solution. It's a collection of identified elements that we've uncovered in multiple customer implementations. These elements presented here are then the generic common architectural elements that we've identified and collected into the generic architecture.    It's our intent to provide an architecture for guidance and not deep technical details. You're smart enough to figure out wiring integration points in your own architectures. You're capable of slotting in the technologies and components you've committed to in the past where applicable.  It's our job here to describe the architectural generic components and outline a few specific cases with visual diagrams so that you're able to make the right decisions from the start of your own projects.    Another challenge has been how to visually represent the architecture. There are many ways to represent each element, but we've chosen some icons, text and colours that we hope are going to make it all easy to absorb.   Now let's take a quick tour of the generic architecture and outline the common elements uncovered in our research.        DIAGNOSTIC FACILITY - EDGE SERVICES   Starting on the left side of the diagram, which is by no means a geographical necessity, there are two elements that represent external systems that are integrated with the core elements of this architecture.    The first are edge devices, covering basically everything that is used in the field from clinical personnel, patients, to partnering vendors. These can be anything from sensor devices to mobile units such as phones or tablets, but certainly not limited to just these. It's a grouping to identify functionality on the edge of this use case.  The second is called x-ray diagnostic server, a slightly specific element containing all of the remote devices, such as an x-ray machine, capturing diagnostic information such as patient images.     DIAGNOSTIC FACILITY - CONTAINER PLATFORM    These elements in the common architecture are found on location at the diagnostic facilities and can be deployed on a container platform to indicate the cloud-ready nature of this architecture.   The image upload application, is used to take the edge captured images and push them back to the medical center for analysis using complexer solutions than are deployed on site. These can also then be used to improve the various artificial intelligence and machine learning models applied to the detection application. They also provide historical data sets of actual images, that after being anonymised, can further many of the research projects such organisations pursue.   Pneumonia detection application is used in the diagnostic facility on site to analyse the images of patients and provide a diagnosis using models provided from the centralised medical facility. This type of application is being updated often as more images are used to train models and expand the machine learning capabilities for a diagnostic facility.    An image registry provides the images needed to deploy the various applications and is updated by pushing new images from the remote medical facility as updates become available.    A separate anonymise data application is tasked with ensuring any patient information and imagery is scrubbed before transporting to the main medical facility where it's made available for further research test sets, model training sets, and other activities.    The notification application is purely a communication vehicle for necessary information between clinical personnel, patients, and other parties as deemed necessary in the diagnostics process.   Without a doubt, one of the most important aspects to any solution of this nature is the integration of information, storage, and applications which we find here in the distributed streaming services. These services ensure near real-time streaming of data, images, and communications across the diagnostic facility, with the edge devices, all manner of user interactions, and with the centralised medical facility.    Finally, the object storage element is of course used to ensure persistence of all manner of objects, such as patient data, images, diagnosis results, and much more.     MEDICAL DATACENTER - CONTAINER PLATFORM  Back in the centralised medical organisation we find the teams that maintain and deliver on the applications, models, dashboards, and the rest of this medical diagnosis solutions.   This collection of elements contains all the base tooling that makes data, models, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applicable for maintaining and improving the medical diagnosis on the edge.    Starting with the top right element in this image, the machine learning element is where models are created, tested on data sets, and tagged for use in the various applications being provided to the edge users.    A dashboard application signifies the ability to monitor the processing of image diagnostics, images, data, and how the entire organisation from edge to backend is performing over time. This can be used to tweak the deployment and usage of the medical diagnostic applications as needed.  The image registry here is used to collect the newly updated and developed application images for eventual sharing out to the image registries located at the supported diagnostic facilities discussed above.   As always, the object storage element is of course used to ensure persistence of all manner of objects, such as patient data, images, diagnosis results, and much more.   The image upload application is used to take the edge-captured images pushed from the diagnostic center for analysis. These are also used to improve the various artificial intelligence and machine learning models applied to the detection application. They also provide historical data sets of actual images, that after being anonymised, can further many of the research projects such organisations pursue.   There is a manual classification application that helps the clinical personnel with medical diagnosis where full automation was unable to bring a case to conclusion.    Finally, we find a machine learning CI/CD element that is used in the development cycle for testing and building images for deployment of applications and other tooling to the image registry.     WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of the common generic elements that make up our architecture for the edge medical diagnosis use case.    An overview of this series on edge medical diagnosis architecture:   1.   2.   3.   4.   Catch up on any articles you missed by following one of the links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at an to provide you with a map for your own medical diagnostic solutions. ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 - Architectural introduction  The last few years we have been digging deeply into the world of architectures with a focus on presenting access to ways of mapping successful implementations for specific use cases.    It's an interesting challenge in that we have the mission of creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns.    That's very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you're basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you're cutting out the chuff.   What's that mean?  It means that it's going to provide you with a way to implement a solution using open source technologies by focusing on the integrations, structures and interactions that actually have been proven to work. What's not included are any vendor promises that you'll find in normal marketing content. Those promised that when it gets down to implementation crunch time, might not fully deliver on their promises.  Enter the term Portfolio Architecture.   Let's look at these architectures, how they're created and what value they provide for your solution designs.     THE PROCESS  The first step is to decide the use case to start with, which in my case had to be linked to a higher level theme that becomes the leading focus. This higher level theme is not quite boiling the ocean, but it's so broad that it's going to require some division into smaller parts.   In this case presented here is we are looking closer at the healthcare industry and we've decided to start with one we're calling the edge medical diagnosis architecture. This use case we've defined as the following:    Accelerating medical diagnosis using condition detection in medical imagery with AI/ML at medical facilities    The approach taken is to research our existing customers that have implemented solutions in this space, collect their public-facing content, research the internal implementation documentation collections from their successful engagements, and where necessary reach out to the field resources involved.    To get an idea of what these architectures look like, we refer you to the series previously discussed here:  *   *   *   *   Now on to the task at hand.     WHAT'S NEXT  The resulting content for this project targets the following three items.   * A slide deck of the architecture for use in telling the portfolio solution    story.  * Generic architectural diagrams providing the general details for the    portfolio solution.  * A write-up of the portfolio solution in a series that can be used for a    customer solution brief.  An overview of this series on edge medical diagnosis architecture:   1.   2.   3.   4.   Catch up on any past articles you missed by following any published links above.  Next in this series, we will take a look at the generic  for the edge medical diagnosis architecture. ]]></content>

<p>This past week, the Wildfly Elytron team (a team specializing in server and client side security) participated in the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/">Open Source Day</a> hackathon.
It is an all day hackathon celebrating Open Source technologies and allowing participants to learn about Open Source and contribute to projects designed to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Issues in the Elytron issue tracker were triaged ahead of the event and new contributors were onboarded and taught about Git, creating and submitting pull requests, and how Open Source works.
The event went well for the Elytron team with double the amount of PRs submitted than in the Summer Open Source Day!</p>
<p>We’d also like to mention that in Wildfly 25 support has been added for the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0. More information and a sample application can be found within <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/10/14/MicroProfile-Reactive-Messaging-2.0-in-WildFly-25/">the announcement</a>.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to yet another installment of the JBoss Editorial! September is coming to an end, but it has been a pretty busy month for the JBoss community.</p><p></p>

<h2 id="_quarkus">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quarkus has really come a long way since the first release only a few years ago. A testament to the fact is certainly the compelling user stories released by the project’s team in the last weeks. First, we have <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/logicdrop-customer-story/">How Quarkus Improved Logicdrop’s Developer Experience and Process</a>, followed by <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/adoptium-customer-story/">Eclipse Adoptium Uses Quarkus for high volume Java SE distribution API</a>. And we even have a nice retail business use case, with <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/decathlon-user-story/">VCStream: a new messaging platform for DECATHLON’s Value Chain, built on Quarkus</a>!</p>
<p>So, if you have yet to jump onboard the Quarkus train, it’s really time to do so! And, to help you do it, you can check out this nice tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/20/quarkus-spring-developers-getting-started">Quarkus for Spring developers: Getting started</a>.

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In the past months, we’ve been doing some hard work to ensure that JBoss software can fit as neatly as possible within an Ansible playbook. There is a still a lot to be done, but we are already quite proud of to two Ansible collections we have released. The first one is called, JCliff, but will soon be renamed to WildFly, as it aims to integrate, as smoothly as possible, the app server into Ansible. The latest version (v.0.0.10) has already a few exciting features:
* systemd integration, a reusable role to help set up WildFly as a systemd service
* a reusable role to install JDBC driver and their module
* and, of course, more fine-tuning of WildFly’s subsystem thanks to the JCLiff (embedded in the collection) which allows Ansible to configure mod_cluster, sockets, JMS queues and so many other features.</p>
<p>We are also very happy about the release of JWS Collection for Ansible (v0.0.2), which allows us to quickly set up Apache Tomcat or its counterpart, JBoss Web Server, but also provides some nice features, like integration with systemd and common criteria (partial) compliance checking. Please check our blog entry about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/30/automate-red-hat-jboss-web-server-deployments-ansible">Ansible collection for Apache Tomcat / JWS</a> for more details!</p>
<p>(Given that those are projects I work on, I fully assume that this entry is a shameless plug :) )</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 11 August 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>After short pause for the summer holiday, welcome back to this new installment of the JBoss Editorial! As always, the JBoss community has been quite active and there is quite a lot to cover today, especially on hybrid cloud and Kogito. Let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_hybrid_cloud">Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>During the last weeks, Christina Lei did a quite interesting series of articles on hybrid cloud. After an <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/overview-of-making-hybrid-multi-cloud.html">overview of making hybrid cloud</a>, she explores some in-depth topic like <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/hybrid-multi-cloud-dynamic-security.html">dynamic security</a> or <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/observability-in-hybrid-multi-cloud">observability</a>. To conclude this serie, another article covers <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/a-study-of-hosting-and-managing-on.html">hosting and managing on hybrid cloud</a>.</p>

<p>With the new release of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-1-9-1-released.html">Kogito 1.9.1</a>, it’s time to explore (maybe again) all the potential of this framework. And fortunately, there are a lot of in-depth articles released recently doing just that! Let’s start with one on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-to-capture-business-decisions-using-dmn-introduction-to-some-basic-patterns-and-their-value.html">how to capture decisions using DMN</a> followed by a tutorial on how to implement <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-task-deadlines.html">task’s deadline</a> with Kogito.</p>

Or explore <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/event-driven-decisioning-with-amq-streams-and-kogito.html">event-driven decisinning with AMQ streams and Kogito</a>. If those articles have but open your appetite for the framework, you can carry on with a tutorial on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-develop-better-widgets-with-showcase-appl.html">how to develop better widgets</a> or how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/add-data-from-kie-execution-server-for-authoring-dashboards.html">add data from KIE server for authoring dashboards</a>.</p>

<p>Karina Varela has a post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/24/automating-rule-based-services-java-and-kogito">automating rule-based services with Java and Kogito</a> up on the Red Hat Developer Blog. The post focuses on Kogito and using it to build, package, and automate the deployment of those rule-based services on Kubernetes and OpenShift!</p>
<p>James Falkner quickly tackles <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/resteasy-reactive-and-more-quarkus-20">RESTEasy Reactive in Quarkus 2.0</a> over on the Red Hat Developer Blog. With the release of Quarkus 2.0 there are a number of things that have improved. Using REST in a reactive way is one of them. Quarkus 2.0 utilizes Eclipse Vert.x 4 and does some optimizations at build time to further increase performance of REST services.</p>
<p>If you’re using Red Hat 3scale API Management and have a need to use WebSockets, be sure to check out Srikanth Kalluru’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/how-expose-websocket-endpoint-using-red-hat-3scale-api-management">blog post</a> for a quick three step walk through of how to get it done!</p>
<p>Mauro Vocale has a three part series, part four is not out yet, about moving Java programs to the cloud. <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/25/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-1-incremental-approach-using-jakarta-ee">Part one</a> introduces you to the legacy application and gets it up and running on OpenShift. This gets you familiar with what the application does and what to expect from further refactorings in subsequent posts. In <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/28/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-2-upgrade-legacy-java-application-jakarta">part two</a> the application will move from Java 8 to Java 11, JBoss EAP 7.3 and Jakarta EE. Lastly, in <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/30/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-3-integrate-microprofile-services">part three</a> the application will be moved to microservices. Additional monitoring tools will be introduced including Prometheus and Jaeger. The application will be updated for handling restarts, health checks, and other configuration settings.</p>
<p>Over in the BPM arena, there are three posts to take a look at: <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/custom-logic-in-bpmn.html">Custom logic in BPMN</a> by Kirill Gaevksii, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/07/how-to-start-contributing-to-drools-executable-model.html">How to start contributing to Drools executable model</a> where Luca Molteni discusses getting your feet with contributing to Drools’s "Executable Model Compiler".

<p>Katia and Ryan on the Infinispan team released a nice two-part series of posts that explained how they built an online game across data centers and multiple cloud providers for this year’s Summit keynote demonstration.
In the first part, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">Building a real-time leaderboard with Infinispan and Quarkus on a hybrid Kubernetes deployment</a>, Katia and Ryan describe how they designed and implemented various services using Infinispan and Quarkus.
With part two, they explain how using the Infinispan Operator greatly reduced the complexity of standing up their clusters, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/08/create-and-manage-red-hat-data-grid-services-hybrid-cloud">Creating and managing Infinispan services in the hybrid cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Tommaso Teofili’s recent post, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/autotuning-lime-explanations-with-few-predictions.html">Autotuning LIME explanations with few predictions</a>, outlines how to automatically tune LIME hyperparameters to achieve more stable explanations and comes with a PR that lets you dig into all the technical aspects covered in the post.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/rhpam-connectivity-to-external-amq-configurations-in-openshift.html">RHPAM connectivity to external AMQ configurations in OpenShift</a> by Michael Perez takes an in-depth look at connecting to an external AMQ with the aim of lowering the memory footprint for RHPAM pods as well as other deployment optimizations.
It’s an interesting read with good technical considerations to sink your teeth into so go give it a look.</p>
<p>Over on the WildFly blog, Jeff Mesnil walks us through the process of changing logging levels for cloud-based WildFly applications on the fly.
Take a look at Jeff’s script and straightforward commands to help you easily modify logs for debugging in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/06/15/change-log-level-wildfly-cloud/">How to Change Logging Level for WildFly on the Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam is back with a post on the Red Hat Developer blog titled <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes">Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes</a>.
I really enjoyed this one as Bilgin expertly puts application modernization in context and examines different patterns, tools, and open-source ecosystems that can help you migrate brown-field systems to more modern, event-driven services as well as design green-field services that are future proof by providing the ability to evolve over time.
Be sure to catch up on this one if you haven’t already read it.</p>
<p>Just in time for your summer reading list the first book dedicated to Keycloak has been published, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2021/06/book.adoc">Keycloak - Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications</a>.
Congrats to authors Stian Thorgersen and Pedro Igor Silva.
It’s an impressive achievement and no doubt the book is full of invaluable expertise.</p>

<p>In our last editorial we mentioned Eric Schabell’s series on a retail data framework.
Since then Eric has obviously been hard at work as his next two posts in the series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-common-architectural-elements.html">Retail data framework - Common architectural elements</a> and <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/06/retail-data-framework-example-data-architecture.html">Retail data framework - Example data architecture</a>.
If you haven’t caught up on that series yet, then I highly recommend taking a look to learn about data flows and management in a retail context.</p>
<p>Eric has also posted the first in his next series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/cloud-adoption-an-architectural-introduction.html">Cloud adoption - An architectural introduction</a>.
This series is focused on proven integrations, structures, and interactions with the goal of enabling readers to implement and adopt cloud-based solutions using open-source technologies.
I’m really excited about this series and can’t wait to see what Eric brings in his next posts.</p>

<p>Jeff Mesnil has authored a very helpful and detailed look at building and deploying WildFly applications on OpenShift using Helm Charts in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/05/05/helm-charts-for-wildfly/">Helm Chart for WildFly</a></p>
<p>Over on the Infinispan blog, Ryan Emerson has shared some details about the CLI compiled to a native image in <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/05/21/infinispan-cli-image">Infinispan Native CLI</a>, which is well worth a read.
You should also try downloading the latest Infinispan 12 server version and taking it for a spin with the native CLI!</p>
<p>Another recent one from the Infinispan team comes from Katia Aresti who, along with Ryan Emerson, explains how they <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">built a real-time leaderboard using Data Grid and several Quarkus extensions</a> to add some magic to this year’s Red Hat Summit Keynote.</p>

<p>Have you been wanting to find out more about Shenandoah GC? Well, you should dive right in and check out Roman Kennke’s informative post, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/20/shenandoah-garbage-collection-openjdk-16-concurrent-reference-processing">Shenandoah garbage collection in OpenJDK 16: Concurrent reference processing</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam has recently posted <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2021/05/data-gateways-of-future.html">Data Gateways in the Cloud Native Era</a> that examines how data gateway components support different use cases and offer a solution for hybrid workloads spread across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least is Claus Ibsen’s webinar, <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/05/webinar-integrate-systems-in-age-of.html">Integrate systems in the age of Quarkus and Camel</a>, that explores how the trio of Camel Quarkus, Camel K, and Kamelets simplify the work to manage and bind systems together.</p>

<p>Eric Schabell never disappoints and his previous series on architectural elements in a real-time stock control solution for retail was no exception.
Eric rounds that series off nicely with <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/real-time-stock-control-example-stock-control-architecture.html">Real-time stock control - Example stock control architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Not one to rest for long, Eric Schabell launches a new series that tackles how to create a framework for accessing retail data from customers, stock, stores, and staff across multiple internal teams.
I’m sure it’s going to be a brilliant series so go have a look for yourself and find out more in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-architectural-introduction.html">Retail data framework - An architectural introduction</a>.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed reading through Christina and Eric’s <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/05/tooling-guide-for-getting-started-with.html">Tooling guide for Getting Started with Apache Camel in 2021</a>.
It’s a well put together beginner’s guide to tools that can help with Camel applications.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 26 April 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another - slightly delayed, installment of our JBoss Editorial! If anything, the last two weeks in the Jboss community has been all about Quarkus and Kogito. Indeed, you’ll find in this post a trove of information and news on the two projects. But also, an exciting opportunity on Keycloak! Without any further ado, let’s jump right in.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keycloak_wants_you">Keycloak wants you!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are developers who is passionate about Keycloak, there is an opportunity of a lifetime for you! The <a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/04/jobs.adoc.html">keycloak team is indeed recruiting!</a>.</p>
<p>Also on the SSO project front, there is a cool post on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/23/integrate-red-hat-data-grid-and-red-hats-single-sign-on-technology-on-red-hat-openshift/">how to integrate Red Data Grid with RHSOO (Keycloak)</a>. Go check it out!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>First of all, a few days ago, yet another (see "Developers on film" below) <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/kogito-serverless-workflow-at-openshift-commons-briefing-2021.html">OpenShift commons briefing around Kogito</a> was delivered (19/04). If the video is (not yet) available, you can checkout the <a href="https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/">examples code from Github</a>.</p>
<p>Then, you may want to catchup on all <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/design-tools-highlights-on-kogito-and-business-central-april-2021.html">the cool features released</a> in the last weeks by the project.</p>
<p>If you are a user of VSCode, there are a few items for you. First, you can go and check out <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/the-score-card-editor-goes-online.html">the score card editors now online</a>. Second, there is a rather tutorial on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-use-test-scenario-editor-to-test-your-dmn-asset-in-vscode.html">using the test scenario editor to validate your DMN assets in VSCode</a>.</p>

<p>With the Red Hat Summit coming up tomorrow, you may want to check out this post of our very own Eric D. Schabell on the new format we are trying out this year: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/red-hat-summit-2021-how-to-enjoy-this-three-part-event-series.html">Red Hat Summit: How to enjoy this three-part event series</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, Eric has, as always, delivered a steady stream of content in the past weeks, with a focus on headless architecture. It started with a first post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, to which he did a followup on: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.</p>
<p>Headless architecture was also part of the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-architectural-introduction.html">Store health and safety architectural introduction</a>, which also was followed up by a post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-common-architectural-elements.html">Store health and safety common architectural elements</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_quarkus_tips_and_tricks">Quarkus tips and tricks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As mentioned in our introduction, Quarkus has been the focused on many content released in the last weeks. On top of that, as you’ll see in the releases section of this editorial, the project has released not one, but two versions, including an alpha of the upcoming Quarkus 2.0.</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the content relating to Quarkus as a development platform. If you are still new to Quarkus, you may want to start then with this post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/07/deploy-quarkus-everywhere-with-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel/">deploying Quarkus everywhere with RHEL</a>. After that, still on the topic of packaging and deployment, you can learn how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/08/build-even-faster-quarkus-applications-with-fast-jar/">build even faster Quarkus applications with Fast jar</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already onboard Quarkus and his very neat development model, you’ll be quite happy to learn that <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/14/mandrel-a-specialized-distribution-of-graalvm-for-quarkus/">Mandrel, a specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus</a> is coming up!</p>
<p>As you may be aware, Quarkus comes already with quite a few supported extensions, but you may still want to learn more about <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/solving-problems-with-custom-extensions/">custom extensions and which problems they can help you solve</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already running or developing a few webapps on Quarkus, you’ll be interested in <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/gui-react-patternfly/">learning how to add eye candy to it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Let’s take a look at what’s been happening in the community since our last editorial.</p>
<p>First up is a post by Hao Wu, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-interact-with-business-processes-using-camel-routes.html">How to Interact with Business Processes Using Camel Routes</a>, that neatly explains using Apache Camel to interact with business processes deployed in a KIE server.</p>
<p>Rebecca Searls, over at the RESTEasy blog, recently added a post titled <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2021/04/05/blog-ParamConverter-with-Quarkus/">JAX-RS ParamConverter with Quarkus</a> that shows how to write RESTful services with Quarkus using the JAX-RS ParamConverter.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell has, yet again, delivered some great posts recently that demonstrate how community technology can solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Finishing off a series of articles on point of sale architectures, Eric delves in a specific example in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-example-image-distribution-architecture.html">Point of sale - Example image distribution architecture</a>.
Be sure to check the links at the end of the post in case you missed any of the other articles in his architecture blueprint for point of sale imaging in retail.</p>
<p>Not one to rest, Eric kicks things off with another series to share an architectural blueprint for the use case of deploying a container-based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>This first article in this series is <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, which gives you an outline for the use case.</p>
<p>Eric then continues the series with his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.
In this article, Eric goes into detail on common generic elements that make up the architecture blueprint for the headless eCommerce use case.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the rest of Eric’s series!
I’m sure there’s lots more great information on the way.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 25 March 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we search through the JBoss Community for interesting articles and updates</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_the_prolific_eric_schabell">Introducing the prolific Eric Schabell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are a regular reader of the JBoss Editorial  you will be very familiar with the work of Eric Schabell, arguably one of the most prolific writers within the JBoss Community.  This edition is no different and sees Eric product three more articles.</p>
<p>Eric’s first article is a continuation of his Supply Chain Integration Blueprint discussion.  In this article Eric <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-example-store-integration-architecture.html">expands on the common architectural elements discussed previously and outlines an example Store integration architecture for Supply Chain integration</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s second article walks us through <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-47-on-local-machine.html">the necessary steps for installing and running the OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 on our local machines</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s final article kicks off a new series of articles within which he will introduce a new architectural blueprint covering <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-an-architectural-introduction.html">"Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications"</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_whats_new_in_kogito_land">What’s new in Kogito land?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The <a href="http://kie.org">Kogito team</a> have been busy over the last few weeks publishing a number of interesting blog posts covering different aspects of the Kogito ecosystem.</p>
<p>We begin our coverage with an article written by William <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/building-prometheus-dashboards-in-business-central.html">demonstrating how to integrate metrics from a Prometheus datasource into the Business Central</a>.  The article walks you through the process from the creation of the data set within Dashbuilder, building the dashboard, how to consider filtering requirements and how to test the dashboard.</p>
<p>The next article, written by Manaswini, follows on from William’s article and <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/time-series-component-for-dashbuilder.html">demonstrates how you can further extend your dashboard through the integration and visualisation of time series data</a>.</p>
<p>The final article, written by Ricardo, introduces us to Kogito’s support for the <a href="https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/">CNCF Serverless Workflow</a> specification, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/restful-services-orchestration-with-kogito-and-openapi.html">allowing Kogito to provide a serverless interface to a service which can also be used to orchestrate RESTful services described through the OpenAPI standard</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_wildfly_using_dns_ping">Clustering WildFly using DNS ping</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>When running within a kubernetes environment it is natural to consider the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING protocol</a> for cluster discovery, a protocol relying on the ability to query the kubernetes API server.  If you want to remain agnostic of your environment, or if you do not have sufficient permissions to query the kubernetes API server, then an alternative approach to consider would be the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">DNS_PING protocol</a> as <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">demonstrated by Yeray using a simple WildFly bootable JAR application</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_optimizing_camel_3_9_no_more_saw_tooth_jvm_garbage_collection">Optimizing Camel 3.9, no more saw tooth JVM garbage collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The upcoming Camel 3.9 release will include some additional, significant improvements in the performance of the internal routing engine leading to a dramatic reduction in object allocation during continuous use.  The Camel team focussed on the five major areas of the codebase they had identified during performance testing with the intention of reducing the allocation count as much as possible, they managed to go one better and achieved a sustained object allocation count of zero!  For more information take a look at <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/03/apache-camel-39-no-more-saw-tooth-jvm.html">Claus' blog describing the effort</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_monitoring_quarkus_applications_on_openshift">Monitoring Quarkus applications on OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are running a Quarkus application on OpenShift you will most likely have a need for integrating with the centralised prometheus instance within the cluster.  This integration is fairly straight forward and can be achieved after following only a few simple steps <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/micrometer-prometheus-openshift/">as ably demonstrated by Jose</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>There’s been a lot of activity since the last editorial so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First up is Ramon Gordillo’s rather interesting take on moving legacy technology on Kubernetes.
Ramon starts by pointing out that even software that is considered "legacy" and traditionally on-prem is often packed with new and useful features.
Add to that the fact that many containerized applications still rely on legacy systems - "not all apps are greenfield" - and he builds a solid case for doing something that might otherwise induce a few gasps.
Go see how Ramon tackles running IBM DB2 in containers, <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2021/03/trying-db2-in-kubernetes-for-developers/">Trying DB2 in Kubernetes for developers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/migrating-jbpm-images-secured-by-ldap-to-elytron.html">Migrating jBPM images secured by LDAP to Elytron</a> by Gonzalo Muñoz Fernández is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
If you’re not familiar with Elytron it is, as Gonzalo explains, Wildfly’s security framework that puts security management and application access into a single subsystem.
In his post, Gonzalo clearly describes and then steps through how to migrate jBPM images from PicketBox, which is a security subsystem based on JAAS login modules, over to Elytron.</p>
<p>Also on the Kogito blog, Paul Brown and Emily Murphy take on the challenge of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/optimizing-covid-19-vaccination-appointment-scheduling.html">Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling</a>.
Their post details the approach for using OptaPlanner to handle planning constraints and automatically assign vaccination appointments.
Getting vaccinations rolled out globally is a massive logistical and planning challenge so it’s comforting to know our community is providing tooling to get us all back to "normal".</p>
<p>The Red Hat Developer blog has a couple of recent entries focused on JavaScript that are both good reads.</p>
<p>Michael Dawson introduces us to the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/08/introduction-to-the-node-js-reference-architecture-part-1-overview/">Node.js reference architecture from Red Hat and IBM</a> and explains their reasons for creating it.
The goal is to help developers make good choices when navigating the vibrant and extensive JavaScript ecosystem by recommending packages based on shared experience across teams and projects.</p>
<p>Joel Lord takes us through <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/building-rootless-containers-for-javascript-front-ends/">Building rootless containers for JavaScript front ends</a> to demonstrate how you can avoid security vulnerabilities and potential disaster.</p>

<p>Our ever productive Eric Schabell has brought us some fantastic content that should really get you thinking about community technology can apply to solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Similarly to James and Emily’s post on the Kogito blog, Eric shows how <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/business-optimisation-architecture-example-vaccine-scheduling-.html">retail pharmacies can optimize scheduling to provide customer vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p>Eric also provides a <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-an-architectural-introduction.html">architectural blueprint for supply-chain integration</a> that comes with a treasure trove of resources and is well worth delving into.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Here we are again, it’s been two weeks and we’re into the second month of 2021!
How quickly times flies!
In this edition, expect to find release information, blog posts, and general updates from around the JBoss Community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-2-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.2.Final</a> is the second maintenance release for the Quarkus 1.11 branch. The notable bug fix with this version is updating to Hibernate ORM 5.4.27.SP1 which fixes a potential data loss issue.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.3.Final</a> is a quick bug fix release that focused on a regression making it impossible to build native executables if your project was using both RESTEasy and OpenTracing. <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.3.Final">Please see the full changelog</a> for more information.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="_highlights_from_the_blogosphere">Highlights from the blogosphere</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Eric Schabell published a migration guide for a traditional JBoss BPM application running either within a VM or on bare-metal to running inside containers using OpenShift Container Platform.
In <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/4-easy-steps-for-migrating-projects-to-openshift-container-platform.html">his post he breaks the migration down into four steps</a>.
I won’t detail them all here, but the steps are very easy and you should be able to get up and running quickly on your own laptop, even without having some of the tech installed previously!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/improvements-of-project-authoring-in-business-central.html">Abhishek Kumar discussed project authoring improvements within Business Central recently on the KIE Blog</a>.
The features he discusses are:
. Opening projects directly with a URL
. Changing the default asset page size
. Security permissions for project screen tools and tabs</p>
<p>Each of these help users in the authoring process within Business Central through either ease of use or security!</p>
<p>Still on the KIE Blog, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/01/how-to-use-a-pmml-file-in-dmn-editor-vscode.html">Yeser Amer demonstrates how to use PMML models in the DMN Editor</a>.
PMML support was released with version 0.7.0.
PMML is an XML file describing a predictive model often generated by data mining or AI algorithms.
The support for this format within the VSCode plugin was recently released and follows the same usage patterns as those found within Business Central, so it may very well be familiar to some.</p>
<p>A number of blogs about Quarkus sprang up over the past couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Firstly, Georgios Andrianakis discusses <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-faq/">achieving massive performance without headaches</a> in a RESTEasy application on Quarkus using RESTEasy Reactive.
He talks about the different models, how to use them, the best way to get performance out of each model, and why this will likely becoming the default model within RESTEasy on Quarkus in the near future.</p>
<p>Clement Escoffier <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/getting-started-amqp/">helps us get started with AMQP in Quarkus</a> with an in-depth demo similar to using Kafka.
He walks you through the basics and gives you a running project which he steps through to show you all the basics.</p>
<p>Over on the Red Hat Developers Blog, Eric Deandrea shows us a very cool trick, or maybe the power of Quarkus’s Spring compatibility, about running a Spring Boot application on Quarkus without changing a single line of Java code!
It is definitely worth the read, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/09/spring-boot-on-quarkus-magic-or-madness/">head on over to check it out</a>!</p>
<p>If you missed the announcement about Quarkus remote development, be sure to read up about it by Daniel Oh <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/11/enhancing-the-development-loop-with-quarkus-remote-development/">on the Red Hat Developer Blog</a>.
Using a mutable-jar package, you can deploy onto OpenShift and continue to develop remotely without having to build a new container and push every time you want to see a change!
What an amazing way to build on the cloud and make sure everything works correctly without having slow downs!</p>
<p>Yeray Borges of the Wildfly team <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/02/01/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-openshift/">demonstrates how to deploy a bootable Wildfly application jar which caches the HTTP session state</a>.
It’s a useful option allowing you to build and test locally and then push to OpenShift with minimal changes ensuring your application still works in the cloud.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mario Fusco and Edson Yanaga have a presentation from a recent DevNation Live about designing a Java API.
Check it out over on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/design-java-apis">the Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Certainly worth the watch if you develop APIs in Java (which should be most of you).</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 28 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Infinispan 12 release, codenamed <code>Lockdown</code>, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new <code>@ProtoAdapter</code> annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It’s a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering <code>SerializationContextInitializer</code> implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There’s a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final">Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11</a> is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0</a> that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/01/keycloak-1202-released.html">Keycloak 12.0.2</a> is now available too!
Head on over to their site and check it out.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 14 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to the first installment of our JBoss Editorial for 2021! And to start the year, we have a brand new major release of the core product of the JBoss community! Yes, Wildfly 22 is out!</p><p></p>

<p>Yes! We have a brand new major version of Wildfly! <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/01/13/WildFly22-Final-Released/">Wildfly 22 is out!</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes support for use of log4j2 in applications, new base health and metrics subsystems to provide server observability for users who don’t need the application instrumentation that comes with MicroProfile Health and Metrics, and a number of other features related to management, provisioning, messaging and security. Plus numerous bug fixes, enhancements and component upgrades.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is also an updated version of the new tech-preview WildFly Preview distribution. This will allow the community have a look at what Wildfly developers are doing for Jakarta EE 9 support, along with other changes in the server architecture that are expected to appear later in 2021.</p>
<p>Wildfly 22 is already a nice treat, but we also have <a href="https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/12/Camel37-Whatsnew/">Camel 3.7</a>, which also quite exciting, and fortunately for all of us, Claus Ibsen has published a review of what he called <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-lts-released-fastest.html">the fastest Camel ever!</a> So, go check it out if you want to know more about this camel release.</p>

<p>A few interesting technical articles came out in the last weeks, so we’ll try to catch you up with three of them here. First, we have an excellent one from Bela Ban on <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/12/running-jgroups-raft-as-service.html">running JGroups raft as a service</a>. It’s very hands on post, focusing on getting everything running.

Certainly, worth a look, isn’t it? The last one is, of course, on Quarkus, because Quarkus is, as it should, all the rage lately. In this article, Clément Escoffier took the time to explain some of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/magic-control">magic beneath Quarkus and Vert.x</a> and why this is the kind magic you to have as a developer.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <article class="" data-tags="Christmas, 2020">
      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 25 December 2020</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this on Christmas Day and have spent the last week or so thinking about what I should put
into my traditional 25th of December entry. Then it came to me in that "lightbulb moment": I’d replicate,
more or less, what I said to my entire team/org before I went on vacation a few days earlier. It’s a summary
of the year and I think it’s relevant for our wider community too. So here it is in a slightly modified form …​</p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you all for the work and interactions you’ve done over this testing year!
I don’t think anyone could have predicted 2020 at the start of the year and I think it’s fair to say that every one of us
has been affected in one way or another. Yet if you look back on the year and the accomplishments we’ve achieved
as a community, you could be forgiven for thinking this was a normal year!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making Quarkus available to all OpenShift customers, which we announced at KubeCon, as well as continuing the innovation within
(e.g., Hibernate Reactive, RESTeasy Reactive);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knative/Serverless, where we now have 7 Working Group leads out of 15 in the Knative community, we also added Functions to OpenShift Serverless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more of our technologies become available to Kube developers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued our close involvement with AdoptOpenJDK (aka Eclipse Adoptium), helping to push it to even greater heights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many great innovations continued around efforts such as Kogito, Strimzi, Camel-K, Eclipse Vert.x, Infinispan, …​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all managed to host, attend, present at countless virtual conferences, workshops and Red Hat Summit; probably enough to realise what
we’re all missing from the real things!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eclipse MicroProfile 4.0 and Eclipse Jakarta EE 9.0 both come to life;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The list could go on and on (e.g., EAP XD, OptaPlanner, …) but my point isn’t so much to call out the successes that this
community have helped to drive but rather to illustrate that we were able to do these and more at all! In the
climate of 2020, retaining the kind of focus we have and continuing to go above and beyond, as many of you and the teams
have, is a testament to Red Hat and our communities, our culture and the supporting bonds you’ve all built up and nurtured. For that
alone I thank you and you should all be incredibly proud!</p>
<p>With that in mind, whether or not you celebrate Christmas or intend to take extended time away, make sure you do take time
to rest and recharge. Be with your friends and family as much as you can given the continuing Covid situation. Find time to unwind
but also congratulate yourself on coming together in 2020 and delivering so much to our communities, partners and customers. I’m not
even going to try to predict what 2021 will be like but if we can replicate what we’ve been able to do in 2020, I’m sure
we’ll all come through it stronger and together!</p>

<p>The last months have certainly been quite active for Quarkus. Now part of the portfolio of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus">Red Hat products</a>, the project has everything but slow down. Just last week a new release, <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-10-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.10.3</a> was published, but also RestEasy announced a large refactoring of its project <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/">RestEasy Reactive</a> in order to integrate and support Quarkus even more. Alessio Soldano, one of the main developers of RestEasy, also shares his thoughts behind this project <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2020/12/07/resteasy-reactive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all in the Quarkiverse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on link:But that’s not all in the Quarkus-verse!

<p>Avro and Apicurio got a lot of attention in the last weeks.

      <h1>This week in JBoss - 20th November 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Today, we’ll focus on some core project of our community. The first one is obviously Wildfly, our Jakarta EE application server whom predecessor (JBoss AS) was the beginning of everything. The second one is our more recent and shiny project, Quarkus. Without any further ado, let’s begin!</em></p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_a_first_taste_of_jakarta_9">Wildfly, a first Taste of Jakarta 9</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release of the <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildfly 21.01</a>, it’s time to put the Jakarta EE server back in the spotlight. Especially as this release gives a <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2020/11/12/Jakarta-EE-9-with-WildFly-Preview/">a preview of Jakarta EE 9</a>! And if your knowledge of the EE standards needs a refresher to fully enjoy this preview, we got you covered with this in depth two-part series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">Jakarta EE multitenancy (part1)</a> and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/12/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-2/">(part 2)</a>.</p>
<p>But Jakarta EE 9 is not the only newsworthy item around Wildfly. The first part of my own series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/06/wildfly-server-configuration-with-ansible-collection-for-jcliff-part-1/">automation of Wildfly using Ansible and JCliff</a> is out! It’s hand on a tutorial on how to set up Ansible and its decided collection for Wildfly (<a href="https://github.com/wildfly-extras/ansible_collections_jcliff">JCliff</a>) in order to fully automate the app server set up and configuration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_leading_the_future_of_java">Quarkus, Leading the Future of Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It might a bold statement, but we’ve made it! Or rather Red Hat made it as Quarkus 1.7 is available as a product for a little while now. Maybe it’s time to finally take a look at it by following this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/leading-the-future-of-java-with-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus-1-7/">Red Hat Quarkus tutorial</a>?</p>
<p>This is also a perfect opportunity to explore Quarkus functionality and ecosystems. For instance, take a look at this interesting post on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-invoke-and-call/">mutiny invoke and call</a>. Or simply explore the cloud readiness of the framework with this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-i-built-a-serverless-blog-search-with-java-quarkus-and-aws-lambda/">building a serverless blog search with Quarkus and AWS lambda</a> and this <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-quarkus-red-hat-openshift?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">introduction to Quarkus on Red Hat Openshift</a>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_techbytes">Techbytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If Quarkus and Wildfly did not quench your thirst for knowledge, let us give you a bit more nuggets. First, why not explore the topic of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/09/openid-connect-integration-with-red-hat-3scale-api-management-and-okta/">using OpenID connect integration with 3scale</a>? Or maybe <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/11/contract-first-development-event-driven.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhFXzh+%28Christina+%E7%9A%84+J%E8%80%81%E9%97%86%29">contract first development using an event-driven approach with Kafka, AMQ Streams, APIcurio</a>? And to make it extra spicy, Christina has even a added a touch of Google protobuf! By the way, if "event driven" is your thing, you can then move this other article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/17/event-driven-serverless-applications-with-camel-k/">event driven serverless with Camel K</a>.</p>
<p>Still hungry for more? Well, maybe it’s time for less crunchy and technical details? What about stepping back and invite some reflection on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/11/open-source-monetization-ecosystem.html">Open Source monetization ecosystem</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In case you somehow missed above (most likely by jumping directly to this section) …​ <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildlfy 21 Alpha 1 has been released</a>!</p>

<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>All this Java made you too jittery? Time for a Java break? Here are a few dry cookies to go along your cup of joe. As mentioned above, the first part of my series on using [Ansible to automate Wildfly setup] might a nice palate cleanser. Also, if you are using Docker you might be interested in this article describing how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman/">transitioning from Docker to Podman</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30 September 2020</h1>
      <p>It’s that time again where we round up the latest news from the community…</p>
<p>Are you looking to develop projects on your local machine, and push them on to a real OpenShift Container Platform, without having to worry about cloud hosting of your container platform?
In this <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/how-to-setup-openshift-container-platform-45.html">post</a> Eric Schabell provides an easy way to get up and running with CodeReady containers on your own development machine.
He’s automated most of the process through scripts, and guides you through the rest of the process.
Eric also shows you how to drop into the Developer console in OCP providing a developer focused view that hides much of the plumbing that is not needed during development.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/call-an-existing-rest-service-with-apache-camel-k/">post</a> Mary Cochran shows us a simple way to connect existing services together using CamelK via each service’s REST APIs.
Mary gets deep into the details providing code examples and commands to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell continues his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">blog series</a>, bringing you architectural blueprints for&nbsp;cloud-native financial payment services.
The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.
This week he covers the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-common-elements.html">Common Architecture Elements</a> that make up the architecture, and gets into some details with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-immediate-payments-example.html">Immediate Payments Example</a>.</p>
<p>As is normal for this time of year, the conference season is beginning to kick off.
Albeit this year in a virtual arena.
Undoubtedly this is an unfortunate situation for those that enjoy the in-person events.
However, it’s great for accessibility and reach allowing many more people across to globe to attend.
DevConf.US 2020 is one such event.
It’s a free, Red Hat sponsored technology conference for community project and professional contributors to Free and Open Source technologies.
Read more <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/devconfus-2020-appdev-containerization-ask-the-experts.html">here</a> where Eric describes the “AppDev &amp; Containerization Ask the Experts” Panels that he and Kurt Stam  will be moderating.</p>
<p>This week Kapil Shukla explains how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/build-a-data-streaming-pipeline-using-kafka-streams-and-quarkus/">build a data streaming pipeline using Kafka Streams and Quarkus</a>.
In this post Kapil shows how data can be processed in real-time as and when it arrives, instead of being batch processed as was needed in the past.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/22/troubleshooting-user-task-errors-in-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/">Post</a> Anton Giertli provides help with troubleshooting user task errors in Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
If you are a developer working with user tasks and having trouble debugging them, this post might well help you out.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Apache Camel VS Code extension (0.0.27) comes several new language support features for Apache Camel.
Read this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/18/new-language-support-features-in-apache-camel-vs-code-extension-0-0-27/">post</a> to learn more.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! The last two weeks have been pretty rich on published content and releases, so let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_spring_boot_to_quarkus">From Spring Boot to Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If most of the content we mentioned today is made of articles, we have one, quite cool video content to share. It’s coming straight from one of the tech-talks of the DevNation and we hope you’ll like it :  <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/secure-vuejs-keycloak">Secure vue.js using Keycloak</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_jgroups_double_your_performance_with_virtual_threads">JGroups: Double your performance with virtual threads!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!! This JDK is still a bit down the road, but its certainly a nice glimpse into tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="_back_to_the_basics">Back to the Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again. First of all, he got his very <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/what-the-dev-podcast-episode-44-agile-integration.html">first interview on a podcast</a> (yep, that’s right, he was never on a podcast before!). With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, he took the time to describe <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/how-to-install-rhpam-77.html">how to How to Install Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7</a> and share his experience with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/shift-remote-2020-devops-heroes.html">Shift Remote 2020 online conference</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 9 July 2020: Over the (j)cliff!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s out! The new major version of Infinispan is here! Please go and check out <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/03/infinispan-11/">Infinispan 11</a>!</p>

<h2 id="_jgroups_new_netty_transport">JGroups: new Netty transport!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’ve said it many times, JGroups is an incredible piece of software. The power and the flexibility of the frameworks always dazzle me, so I’m very excited about this <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a> getting into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_serverless_and_microservice">Serverless and Microservice</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As alluring as “serverless” is, it does, like any other technology, come with its own challenges. Follow Christina as she goes through the importance of having the proper infrastructure to support your “serverless” apps in this well thought out blog entry: <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/07/serverless-integration-components.html">Serverless Integration Components</a></p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_microprofile">Microprofile</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release JBoss EAP XP, there are a lot of opportunities to develop supported microprofile application. So if you want to explore how to develop such an application, please follow <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/ehugonne/">Emmanuel Hugonnet</a>’s tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/01/develop-eclipse-microprofile-applications-on-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-with-red-hat-codeready-workspaces/">Develop Eclipse MicroProfile applications on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0 with Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>We’re a little light on the news this time, but those of us who have been reading the editorial for a few years will be familiar with the "after Summit slump."
With Red Hat Summit behind us (and what a great Summit, check out the sessions on demand if you missed them), many people have taken PTO.
Expect all the news, blogs, releases, etc. to pick back up in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>All that being said, we do have some blogs to go over and one release.</p><p></p>

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>
